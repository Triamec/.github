**Redefining Motion Control** since 2001 🦾, we at Triamec have been using open source software for the entire life cycle of our products. Therefore, we are happy to start our journey on GitHub 🚀 making our open source snippets, examples and tools more accessible to our customers and the community 😍!

In our repositories you find code examples and tools for [Tama](https://www.triamec.com/en/tama-realtime-programming.html) and the [TAM API](https://www.triamec.com/en/tam-api.html).
You can download the [TAM Software](https://www.triamec.com/en/tam-software-support.html) from our website.

We are looking forward to your feedback, issues and pull requests - 🎉 building the Triamec community 🎉
